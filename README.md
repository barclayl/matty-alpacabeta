## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Expo CLI installed globally: `npm install -g @expo/cli`
- iOS Simulator or Android emulator (or Expo Go app on your device)
- Alpaca API credentials (for sandbox environment)
- Lithic API credentials (optional, for virtual card creation)

### Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Copy the `.env` file and add your API credentials:
   ```bash
   # Required for Alpaca integration
   ALPACA_API_KEY=your_alpaca_api_key_here
   ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_alpaca_secret_key_here
   
   # Optional for Lithic card creation
   LITHIC_API_KEY=your_lithic_api_key_here
   ```
   
   # Required for Stripe payments
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key_here
   EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key_here
   
   **Getting Alpaca API Keys:**
   1. Sign up at [Alpaca Broker API](https://alpaca.markets/broker)
   2. Navigate to the sandbox environment
   3. Generate your API key and secret key
   4. Add them to your `.env` file
   
   **Getting Stripe API Keys:**
   1. Sign up at [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)
   2. Navigate to the Developers section
   3. Get your publishable and secret keys from the API keys page
   4. Use the test keys (starting with `pk_test_` and `sk_test_`)
   5. Add them to your `.env` file

3. **Start the Backend Server**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   The server will start on http://localhost:3001

4. **Start the Expo Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Run the App**
   - **iOS Simulator**: Press `i` in the terminal
   - **Android Emulator**: Press `a` in the terminal
   - **Physical Device**: Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app
   
   **Note**: For Google Pay functionality, you'll need to create a development build:
   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   ```
   Google Pay requires native code and won't work in Expo Go.

2. Add comprehensive error handling and validation
3. Implement proper user authentication and security measures
4. Add comprehensive testing (unit, integration, e2e)
5. Follow financial industry compliance requirements
6. Add proper analytics and monitoring

## Support

For technical questions or issues:
1. Check the API endpoint responses in the server console
2. Verify all dependencies are installed correctly  
3. Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running
4. Check network connectivity between frontend and backend
